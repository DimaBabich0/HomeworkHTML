    <h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>

    <h2>Linear Equations</h2>

    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>

    <div>ax + b = 0</div>

    <p>
        where <span class="variable">a</span> and <span class="variable">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="variable">x</span> is a variable. 
        This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. 
        Also, the variable may or may not be an <span class="variable">x</span> so don't get too locked into always seeing an <span class="variable">x</span> there.
    </p>

    <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>

    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>

    <div>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</div> 

    <p>
        where <span class="variable">a</span>, <span class="variable">b</span>, <span class="variable">c</span> are known values 
        and <span class="variable">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="variable">a</span> can't be 0.
    </p>

    <h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>

    <p><span class="variable">&#960;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="variable">r</span>) squared:</p>
    <div>A = &#960; &times; r<sup>2</sup> </div> 

    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="variable">D</span>):</p>
    <div>A = (&#960;/ 4) &times; D<sup>2</sup></div>  

    <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span class="variable">C</span>):</p>
    <div>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &times; &#960;</div>

    <h2>Intersection</h2>

    <p>
        The intersection of two sets <span class="variable">A</span> and <span class="variable">B</span>, 
        denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,
    </p>

    <div>A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }</div>

    <p>
        That is, <span class="variable">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &cap; B if and only if 
        <span class="variable">x</span> is both an element of <span class="variable">A</span>
        and an element of <span class="variable">B</span>.
